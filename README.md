boost-python-bullet
===================
This is a thin boost wrapper on top of Bullet Physics SDK (http://bulletphysics.org)

It exposes a limited subset of classes.

You can use the bullet physics manual for reference but member methods have been renamed to python notation:

setRotation -> set_rotation
setValue -> set_value

etc...
